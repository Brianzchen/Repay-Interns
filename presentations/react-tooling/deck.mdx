# React/UI Tooling

---

# What is React?

- JavaScript library used for building user interfaces
- Divides a UI into smaller pieces called components
- Uses JSX to add HTML elements to a page
- Manages component-level state to control how information is displayed
- Allows for declarative UI development

---

# Components

- Building blocks of a React application
- Class/Functional components
- Use props to pass data down to different components
- Every component has a state

---

# JSX

- React extension that allows us to write code that *looks like* HTML
- JSX elements have tag names and attributes just like HTML
- Allows us to bridge JavaScript & HTML

---

# State

- Should contain data important to the component
- Changes to state trigger a re-render
- Any data that may have an affect on what is rendered should be stored in the state

An Example of a Class Component

```jsx
import React from 'react'
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props)
    this.state = { clicked: 0 }
  }
  onClick = () => {
    const count = this.state.clicked
    this.setState({ clicked: count++ })
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={onClick}>Click me</button>
        <span>You clicked {this.state.clicked} times</span>
      </div>
    )
  }
}
```
</Split>

<SplitRight>
An Example of a Functional Component

```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'
export const MyComponent = props => {
  const [clicked, setClicked] = useState(0)
  const onClick = () => {
    const count = clicked
    setClicked(clicked => (count++))
  }
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={onClick}>Click me</button>
      <span>You clicked {clicked} times</span>
    </div>
  )
}
```
</SplitRight>

# What Tooling Exists for React?

- CSS
- Routers
- Redux
- Testing Libraries
- React Dev Tools

---

# CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)

- React renders the components, but CSS is responsible for styling
- Define classNames and styles in CSS and provide the classNames to JSX elements
- Colors, borders, layout/positioning, animations/translations, etc
- Some CSS features limited in certain browsers (cough cough, IE)

---

# Routers

- Handle the navigation to & from different pages in an application
- Each `<Route />` gets a `path` and a `component`
- Routers provide `<Link />` components that accept a `to` prop, which corresponds to a `path`
- `react-router`
- `@reach/router`

---

# Redux

- Used for application state management
- Create a store
- Update store by dispatching actions
- Reducer functions decide what to do with an action and its payload, & return a new state
- Useful when data should persist at a global level (user session, caching, etc)

---

# Testing Libraries

- Jest
- React Testing Library
- Enzyme
- Test Cafe
- Puppeteer

---

# React Dev Tools

- Chrome extension to assist with React debugging
- Enables inspection of the the React component hierarchy in the browser
- Allows modification of component props & state

---

# Why is React a Good Choice for Us?

- Large dynamic front end applications
- Reusable components
- Virtual DOM (very efficient)
- Declarative UI

---

# What is Declarative UI?

- Components can render content given the *what*, not the *how*.
- Separate the look of the UI from the logic/behavior
